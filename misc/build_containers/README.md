# Godot engine build containers

Based on https://github.com/godotengine/build-containers

This repository contains the Dockerfiles for the official Godot engine builds. These containers should help you build Godot for all platforms supported on any machine that can run Docker containers.

## Building

There is a 'build.sh' script included to build the containers themselves. The in-container build scripts will follow shortly.
