// #define RENDERING_SERVER_CANVAS_TIME_NODE_CULLING

// N.B. ONLY allow these defined in DEV_ENABLED builds, they will slow
// performance, and are only necessary to use for debugging.

// This is relatively expensive, but is invaluable for debugging the canvas scene tree
// especially using _print_tree() in RenderingServerCanvas.

// Uncomment this define to verify local bounds of canvas items,
// to check that the hierarchical culling is working correctly.
// This is expensive.

// Uncomment this define to produce debugging output for physics interpolation.
