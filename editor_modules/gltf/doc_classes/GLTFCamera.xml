	<members>
		<member name="fov_size" type="float" setter="set_fov_size" getter="get_fov_size" default="1.309">
			The FOV of the camera. This class and GLTF define the camera FOV in radians, while Godot uses degrees. This maps to GLTF's [code]yfov[/code] property. This value is only used for perspective cameras, when [member perspective] is true.
		</member>
		<member name="perspective" type="bool" setter="set_perspective" getter="get_perspective" default="true">
			Whether or not the camera is in perspective mode. If false, the camera is in orthographic/orthogonal mode. This maps to GLTF's camera [code]type[/code] property. See [member Camera.projection] and the GLTF spec for more information.
		</member>
		<member name="size_mag" type="float" setter="set_size_mag" getter="get_size_mag" default="0.5">
			The size of the camera. This class and GLTF define the camera size magnitude as a radius in meters, while Godot defines it as a diameter in meters. This maps to GLTF's [code]ymag[/code] property. This value is only used for orthographic/orthogonal cameras, when [member perspective] is false.
		</member>
		<member name="zfar" type="float" setter="set_zfar" getter="get_zfar" default="4000.0">
			The distance to the far culling boundary for this camera relative to its local Z axis, in meters. This maps to GLTF's [code]zfar[/code] property.
		</member>
		<member name="znear" type="float" setter="set_znear" getter="get_znear" default="0.05">
			The distance to the near culling boundary for this camera relative to its local Z axis, in meters. This maps to GLTF's [code]znear[/code] property.
