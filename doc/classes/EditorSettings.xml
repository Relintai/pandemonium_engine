	</brief_description>
	<description>
		Object that holds the project-independent editor settings. These settings are generally visible in the [b]Editor &gt; Editor Settings[/b] menu.
		Property names use slash delimiters to distinguish sections. Setting values can be of any [Variant] type. It's recommended to use [code]snake_case[/code] for editor settings to be consistent with the Godot editor itself.
		Accessing the settings can be done using the following methods, such as:
		[codeblock]
		# `settings.set("some/property", value)` also works as this class overrides `_set()` internally.
		settings.set_setting("some/property",value)

		# `settings.get("some/property", value)` also works as this class overrides `_get()` internally.
		settings.get_setting("some/property")

		var list_of_settings = settings.get_property_list()
		[/codeblock]
		[b]Note:[/b] This class shouldn't be instantiated directly. Instead, access the singleton using [method EditorInterface.get_editor_settings].

		<member name="docks/property_editor/auto_refresh_interval" type="float" setter="" getter="">
			The refresh interval to use for the inspector dock's properties. The effect of this setting is mainly noticeable when adjusting gizmos in the 2D/3D editor and looking at the inspector at the same time. Lower values make the inspector more often, but take up more CPU time.
		</member>
		<member name="docks/property_editor/subresource_hue_tint" type="float" setter="" getter="">
			The tint intensity to use for the subresources background in the inspector dock. The tint is used to distinguish between different subresources in the inspector. Higher values result in a more noticeable background color difference.

		</member>
		<member name="editors/2d/scroll_to_pan" type="bool" setter="" getter="">
			If [code]true[/code], scrolling the mouse wheel will pan vertically instead of zoom in the 2D editor. Holding [kbd]Shift[/kbd] at the same time will pan horizontally instead of vertically. See [member editors/2d/pan_speed] to adjust the scrolling speed.
			[b]Note:[/b] If [code]true[/code], holding [kbd]Ctrl[/kbd] will temporarily override this behavior and will zoom instead of pan.

		</member>
		<member name="editors/2d/warped_mouse_panning" type="bool" setter="" getter="">
			If [code]true[/code], wraps around the mouse cursor when it reaches one of the 2D editor viewport's edges. This makes panning over large areas easier, as you don't have to stop and reposition the mouse every time it's about to hit the screen's borders.
		</member>
		<member name="editors/3d/default_fov" type="float" setter="" getter="">
			The default camera field of view to use in the 3D editor (in degrees). The camera field of view can be adjusted on a per-scene basis using the [b]View[/b] menu at the top of the 3D editor. If a scene had its camera field of view adjusted using the [b]View[/b] menu, this setting is ignored in the scene in question. This setting is also ignored while a Camera3D node is being previewed in the editor.
		</member>
		<member name="editors/3d/default_z_far" type="float" setter="" getter="">
			The default camera far clip distance to use in the 3D editor (in degrees). Higher values make it possible to view objects placed further away from the camera, at the cost of lower precision in the depth buffer (which can result in visible Z-fighting in the distance). The camera far clip distance can be adjusted on a per-scene basis using the [b]View[/b] menu at the top of the 3D editor. If a scene had its camera far clip distance adjusted using the [b]View[/b] menu, this setting is ignored in the scene in question. This setting is also ignored while a Camera3D node is being previewed in the editor.
		</member>

Lower values make it possible to view objects placed closer to the camera, at the cost of lower precision in the depth buffer (which can result in visible Z-fighting in the distance). The camera near clip distance can be adjusted on a per-scene basis using the [b]View[/b] menu at the top of the 3D editor. If a scene had its camera near clip distance adjusted using the [b]View[/b] menu, this setting is ignored in the scene in question. This setting is also ignored while a Camera3D node is being previewed in the editor.

		<member name="editors/3d/freelook/freelook_activation_modifier" type="int" setter="" getter="">
			The modifier key to use to enable freelook in the 3D editor (on top of pressing the right mouse button).
			[b]Note:[/b] Regardless of this setting, the freelook toggle keyboard shortcut ([kbd]Shift + F[/kbd] by default) is always available.
			[b]Note:[/b] On certain window managers on Linux, the [kbd]Alt[/kbd] key will be intercepted by the window manager when clicking a mouse button at the same time. This means Godot will not see the modifier key as being pressed.
		</member>
		<member name="editors/3d/freelook/freelook_base_speed" type="float" setter="" getter="">
			The base 3D freelook speed in units per second. This can be adjusted by using the mouse wheel while in freelook mode, or by holding down the "fast" or "slow" modifier keys ([kbd]Shift[/kbd] and [kbd]Alt[/kbd] by default, respectively).
		</member>
		<member name="editors/3d/freelook/freelook_inertia" type="float" setter="" getter="">
			The inertia of the 3D freelook camera. Higher values make the camera start and stop slower, which looks smoother but adds latency.
		</member>
		<member name="editors/3d/freelook/freelook_navigation_scheme" type="int" setter="" getter="">
			The navigation scheme to use when freelook is enabled in the 3D editor. Some of the navigation schemes below may be more convenient when designing specific levels in the 3D editor.
			- [b]Default:[/b] The "Freelook Forward", "Freelook Backward", "Freelook Up" and "Freelook Down" keys will move relative to the camera, taking its pitch angle into account for the movement.
			- [b]Partially Axis-Locked:[/b] The "Freelook Forward" and "Freelook Backward" keys will move relative to the camera, taking its pitch angle into account for the movement. The "Freelook Up" and "Freelook Down" keys will move in an "absolute" manner, [i]not[/i] taking the camera's pitch angle into account for the movement.
			- [b]Fully Axis-Locked:[/b] The "Freelook Forward", "Freelook Backward", "Freelook Up" and "Freelook Down" keys will move in an "absolute" manner, [i]not[/i] taking the camera's pitch angle into account for the movement.

			The smallest grid division to use in the 3D editor, specified as a power of 2. The grid will not be able to get larger than [code]1 ^ grid_division_level_max[/code] units. By default, this means grid divisions cannot get smaller than 100 units each, no matter how far away the camera is from the grid.
		</member>
		<member name="editors/3d/grid_division_level_min" type="int" setter="" getter="">
			The smallest grid division to use in the 3D editor, specified as a power of 2. The grid will not be able to get smaller than [code]1 ^ grid_division_level_min[/code] units. By default, this means grid divisions cannot get smaller than 1 unit each, no matter how close the camera is from the grid.
		</member>
		<member name="editors/3d/grid_size" type="int" setter="" getter="">
			The grid size in units. Higher values prevent the grid from appearing "cut off" at certain angles, but make the grid more demanding to render. Depending on the camera's position, the grid may not be fully visible since a shader is used to fade it progressively.
		</member>
		<member name="editors/3d/grid_xy_plane" type="bool" setter="" getter="">

			When 3-button mouse emulation mode is enabled, the pan, zoom and orbit modifiers can always be used in the 3D editor viewport, even when not holding down any mouse button.
			[b]Note:[/b] No matter the orbit modifier configured in [member editors/3d/navigation/orbit_modifier], [kbd]Alt[/kbd] will always remain usable for orbiting in this mode to improve usability with graphics tablets.
