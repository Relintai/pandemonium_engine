		<member name="canvas" type="RID" setter="" getter="get_canvas">
			The [RID] of this world's canvas resource. Used by the [RenderingServer] for 2D drawing.
		</member>
		<member name="direct_space_state" type="Physics2DDirectSpaceState" setter="" getter="get_direct_space_state">
			Direct access to the world's physics 2D space state. Used for querying current and potential collisions. When using multi-threaded physics, access is limited to [code]_physics_process(delta)[/code] in the main thread.
		</member>
		<member name="navigation_map" type="RID" setter="" getter="get_navigation_map">
			The [RID] of this world's navigation map. Used by the [Navigation2DServer].
		</member>
		<member name="space" type="RID" setter="" getter="get_space">
			The [RID] of this world's physics space resource. Used by the [Physics2DServer] for 2D physics, treating it as both a space and an area.
		</member>
		<member name="vertex_lights_2d_map" type="RID" setter="" getter="get_vertex_lights_2d_map">
			The [RID] of this world's vertex light 2d space resource. Used by the [VertexLights2DServer] for static 2D lights. If the vertex lights 2d module is not enabled this will just return an empty RID.
