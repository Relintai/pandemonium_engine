	</brief_description>
	<description>
		Can have [PathFollow2D] child nodes moving along the [Curve2D]. See [PathFollow2D] for more information on usage.
		[b]Note:[/b] The path is considered as relative to the moved nodes (children of [PathFollow2D]). As such, the curve should usually start with a zero vector ([code](0, 0)[/code]).
