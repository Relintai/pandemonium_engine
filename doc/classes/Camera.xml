		Camera node, displays from a point of view.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		Camera is a special node that displays what is visible from its current location. Cameras register themselves in the nearest [Viewport] node (when ascending the tree). Only one camera can be active per viewport. If no viewport is available ascending the tree, the camera will register in the global viewport. In other words, a camera just provides 3D display capabilities to a [Viewport], and, without one, a scene registered in that [Viewport] (or higher viewports) can't be displayed.

				# `control` is a reference to a node inheriting from Control.
				control.visible = not get_viewport().get_camera().is_position_behind(global_transform.origin)

			If [code]true[/code], the camera will be used to calculate the level of detail in [LOD] nodes.
			Objects further from the camera will select lower levels of detail than those closer to the camera.
			[b]Note:[/b] This property has no effect if [member projection] is set to [constant PROJECTION_ORTHOGONAL].

			If [code]true[/code], the ancestor [Viewport] is currently using this camera.
			If multiple cameras are in the scene, one will always be made current. For example, if two [Camera] nodes are present in the scene and only one is current, setting one camera's [member current] to [code]false[/code] will cause the other camera to be made current.

			- ~86.07 degrees in a 4:3 viewport
