	<brief_description>
		Spherical occlusion primitive for use with the [Occluder] node.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		[OccluderShape]s are resources used by [Occluder] nodes, allowing geometric occlusion culling.
		This shape can include multiple spheres. These can be created and deleted either in the Editor inspector or by calling [code]set_spheres[/code]. The sphere positions can be set by dragging the handle in the Editor viewport. The radius can be set with the smaller handle.
