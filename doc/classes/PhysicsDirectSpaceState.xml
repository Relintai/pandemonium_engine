		<method name="cast_motion">
			<return type="Array" />
			<argument index="0" name="shape" type="PhysicsShapeQueryParameters" />
			<argument index="1" name="motion" type="Vector3" />
			<description>
				Checks how far a [Shape] can move without colliding. All the parameters for the query, including the shape, are supplied through a [PhysicsShapeQueryParameters] object.
				Returns an array with the safe and unsafe proportions (between 0 and 1) of the motion. The safe proportion is the maximum fraction of the motion that can be made without a collision. The unsafe proportion is the minimum fraction of the distance that must be moved for a collision. If no collision is detected a result of [code][1.0, 1.0][/code] will be returned.
				[b]Note:[/b] Any [Shape]s that the shape is already colliding with e.g. inside of, will be ignored. Use [method collide_shape] to determine the [Shape]s that the shape is already colliding with.

		<method name="collide_shape">
			<return type="Array" />
			<argument index="0" name="shape" type="PhysicsShapeQueryParameters" />
			<argument index="1" name="max_results" type="int" default="32" />
			<description>
				Checks the intersections of a shape, given through a [PhysicsShapeQueryParameters] object, against the space. The resulting array contains a list of points where the shape intersects another. Like with [method intersect_shape], the number of returned results can be limited to save processing time.

		<method name="get_rest_info">
			<return type="Dictionary" />
			<argument index="0" name="shape" type="PhysicsShapeQueryParameters" />
			<description>
				Checks the intersections of a shape, given through a [PhysicsShapeQueryParameters] object, against the space. If it collides with more than one shape, the nearest one is selected. The returned object is a dictionary containing the following fields:
				[code]collider_id[/code]: The colliding object's ID.
				[code]linear_velocity[/code]: The colliding object's velocity [Vector3]. If the object is an [Area], the result is [code](0, 0, 0)[/code].
				[code]normal[/code]: The object's surface normal at the intersection point.
				[code]point[/code]: The intersection point.
				[code]rid[/code]: The intersecting object's [RID].
				[code]shape[/code]: The shape index of the colliding shape.
				If the shape did not intersect anything, then an empty dictionary is returned instead.

			<argument index="0" name="point" type="Vector3" />
			<argument index="1" name="max_results" type="int" default="32" />
			<argument index="2" name="exclude" type="Array" default="[  ]" />
			<argument index="3" name="collision_layer" type="int" default="2147483647" />
			<argument index="4" name="collide_with_bodies" type="bool" default="true" />
			<argument index="5" name="collide_with_areas" type="bool" default="false" />
			<description>
				Checks whether a point is inside any solid shape. The shapes the point is inside of are returned in an array containing dictionaries with the following fields:
				[code]collider[/code]: The colliding object.
				[code]collider_id[/code]: The colliding object's ID.
				[code]rid[/code]: The intersecting object's [RID].
				[code]shape[/code]: The shape index of the colliding shape.
				The number of intersections can be limited with the [code]max_results[/code] parameter, to reduce the processing time.
				Additionally, the method can take an [code]exclude[/code] array of objects or [RID]s that are to be excluded from collisions, a [code]collision_mask[/code] bitmask representing the physics layers to check in, or booleans to determine if the ray should collide with [PhysicsBody]s or [Area]s, respectively.

				Intersects a ray in a given space. The returned object is a dictionary with the following fields:
				[code]collider[/code]: The colliding object.
				[code]collider_id[/code]: The colliding object's ID.
