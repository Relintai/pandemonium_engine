	<brief_description>
		Node that represents collision shape data in 2D space.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		Editor facility for creating and editing collision shapes in 2D space. Set the [member shape] property to configure the shape. [b]IMPORTANT[/b]: this is an Editor-only helper to create shapes, use [method CollisionObject2D.shape_owner_get_shape] to get the actual shape.
		You can use this node to represent all sorts of collision shapes, for example, add this to an [Area2D] to give it a detection shape, or add it to a [PhysicsBody2D] to create a solid object.

		<member name="disabled" type="bool" setter="set_disabled" getter="is_disabled" default="false">
			A disabled collision shape has no effect in the world. This property should be changed with [method Object.set_deferred].
		</member>
		<member name="one_way_collision" type="bool" setter="set_one_way_collision" getter="is_one_way_collision_enabled" default="false">
			Sets whether this collision shape should only detect collision on one side (top or bottom).
			[b]Note:[/b] This property has no effect if this [CollisionShape2D] is a child of an [Area2D] node.
		</member>
		<member name="one_way_collision_margin" type="float" setter="set_one_way_collision_margin" getter="get_one_way_collision_margin" default="1.0">
			The margin used for one-way collision (in pixels). Higher values will make the shape thicker, and work better for colliders that enter the shape at a high velocity.
		</member>
		<member name="shape" type="Shape2D" setter="set_shape" getter="get_shape">
			The actual shape owned by this collision shape.
