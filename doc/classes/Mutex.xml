	<description>
		A synchronization mutex (mutual exclusion). This is used to synchronize multiple [Thread]s, and is equivalent to a binary [Semaphore]. It guarantees that only one thread can ever acquire the lock at a time. A mutex can be used to protect a critical section; however, be careful to avoid deadlocks.

	<methods>
		<method name="lock">
			<return type="void" />
			<description>
				Locks this [Mutex], blocks until it is unlocked by the current owner.
				[b]Note:[/b] This function returns without blocking if the thread already has ownership of the mutex.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="try_lock">
			<return type="int" enum="Error" />
			<description>
				Tries locking this [Mutex], but does not block. Returns [constant OK] on success, [constant ERR_BUSY] otherwise.
				[b]Note:[/b] This function returns [constant OK] if the thread already has ownership of the mutex.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="unlock">
			<return type="void" />
			<description>
				Unlocks this [Mutex], leaving it to other threads.
				[b]Note:[/b] If a thread called [method lock] or [method try_lock] multiple times while already having ownership of the mutex, it must also call [method unlock] the same number of times in order to unlock it correctly.
