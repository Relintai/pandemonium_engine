	<brief_description>
		3D area for detection and physics and audio influence.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		3D area that detects [CollisionObject] nodes overlapping, entering, or exiting. Can also alter or override local physics parameters (gravity, damping) and route audio to a custom audio bus.
		To give the area its shape, add a [CollisionShape] or a [CollisionPolygon] node as a [i]direct[/i] child (or add multiple such nodes as direct children) of the area.
		[b]Warning:[/b] See [ConcavePolygonShape] (also called "trimesh") for a warning about possibly unexpected behavior when using that shape for an area.
		[b]Warning:[/b] With a non-uniform scale this node will probably not function as expected. Please make sure to keep its scale uniform (i.e. the same on all axes), and change the size(s) of its collision shape(s) instead.

		<method name="get_overlapping_areas" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="Array" />
			<description>
				Returns a list of intersecting [Area]s. The overlapping area's [member CollisionObject.collision_layer] must be part of this area's [member CollisionObject.collision_mask] in order to be detected.
				For performance reasons (collisions are all processed at the same time) this list is modified once during the physics step, not immediately after objects are moved. Consider using signals instead.

		<method name="get_overlapping_bodies" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="Array" />
			<description>
				Returns a list of intersecting [PhysicsBody]s. The overlapping body's [member CollisionObject.collision_layer] must be part of this area's [member CollisionObject.collision_mask] in order to be detected.

		<method name="overlaps_area" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="bool" />
			<argument index="0" name="area" type="Node" />
			<description>
				If [code]true[/code], the given area overlaps the Area.
				[b]Note:[/b] The result of this test is not immediate after moving objects. For performance, list of overlaps is updated once per frame and before the physics step. Consider using signals instead.

		<method name="overlaps_body" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="bool" />
			<argument index="0" name="body" type="Node" />
			<description>
				If [code]true[/code], the given physics body overlaps the Area.
				[b]Note:[/b] The result of this test is not immediate after moving objects. For performance, list of overlaps is updated once per frame and before the physics step. Consider using signals instead.
				The [code]body[/code] argument can either be a [PhysicsBody] or a [GridMap] instance (while GridMaps are not physics body themselves, they register their tiles with collision shapes as a virtual physics body).
