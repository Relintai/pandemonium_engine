	<brief_description>
		Editor-only class for defining a collision polygon in 3D space.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		Allows editing a collision polygon's vertices on a selected plane. Can also set a depth perpendicular to that plane. This class is only available in the editor. It will not appear in the scene tree at run-time. Creates a [Shape] for gameplay. Properties modified during gameplay will have no effect.
		[b]Warning:[/b] A non-uniformly scaled CollisionPolygon3D node will probably not function as expected. Please make sure to keep its scale uniform (i.e. the same on all axes), and change its [member polygon]'s vertices instead.

		<member name="depth" type="float" setter="set_depth" getter="get_depth" default="1.0">
			Length that the resulting collision extends in either direction perpendicular to its polygon.
		</member>
		<member name="disabled" type="bool" setter="set_disabled" getter="is_disabled" default="false">
			If [code]true[/code], no collision will be produced.
		</member>
		<member name="margin" type="float" setter="set_margin" getter="get_margin" default="0.04">
			The collision margin for the generated [Shape]. See [member Shape.margin] for more details.
		</member>
		<member name="polygon" type="PoolVector2Array" setter="set_polygon" getter="get_polygon" default="PoolVector2Array(  )">
			Array of vertices which define the polygon.
			[b]Note:[/b] The returned value is a copy of the original. Methods which mutate the size or properties of the return value will not impact the original polygon. To change properties of the polygon, assign it to a temporary variable and make changes before reassigning the [code]polygon[/code] member.
