	<brief_description>
		Contains a [Curve3D] path for [PathFollow] nodes to follow.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		Can have [PathFollow] child nodes moving along the [Curve3D]. See [PathFollow] for more information on the usage.
		Note that the path is considered as relative to the moved nodes (children of [PathFollow]). As such, the curve should usually start with a zero vector [code](0, 0, 0)[/code].
