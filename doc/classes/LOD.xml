	<brief_description>
		Provides discrete level of detail.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		Automatically hides and shows [Spatial] children depending on the distance from the closest [Camera] to the [LOD] node. Child nodes that don't inherit from [Spatial] are ignored by the LOD system.
		Children are shown in order with the first children shown when closest to the [Camera], and the latter children shown when further away.
		The threshold distances for changes are determined by [member Spatial.lod_range].
		For example, a first child with a range of [code]2[/code] will be shown from distance 0 to 2. A second child with a range of [code]5[/code] will be shown from distance 2 to 7, etc.

			To prevent flickering at borders, a hysteresis distance will be added to threshold distances when the object is moving away from the [Camera].
