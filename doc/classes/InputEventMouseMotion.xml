	<brief_description>
		Input event type for mouse motion events.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		Contains mouse and pen motion information. Supports relative, absolute positions and speed. See [method Node._input].
		[b]Note:[/b] The behavior of this event is affected by the value of [member Input.use_accumulated_input]. When set to [code]true[/code] (default), mouse/pen motion events received from the OS will be merged to emit an accumulated event only once per frame rendered at most. When set to [code]false[/code], the events will be emitted as received, which means that they can be emitted multiple times per frame rendered, allowing for precise input reporting at the expense of CPU usage.
		[b]Note:[/b] If you use InputEventMouseMotion to draw lines, consider implementing [url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bresenham%27s_line_algorithm]Bresenham's line algorithm[/url] as well to avoid visible gaps in lines if the user is moving the mouse quickly.

		<member name="pen_inverted" type="bool" setter="set_pen_inverted" getter="get_pen_inverted" default="false">
			Returns [code]true[/code] when using the eraser end of a stylus pen.
			[b]Note:[/b] This property is implemented on Linux, macOS and Windows.
		</member>
		<member name="pressure" type="float" setter="set_pressure" getter="get_pressure" default="0.0">
			Represents the pressure the user puts on the pen. Ranges from [code]0.0[/code] to [code]1.0[/code].
		</member>
		<member name="relative" type="Vector2" setter="set_relative" getter="get_relative" default="Vector2( 0, 0 )">
			The mouse position relative to the previous position (position at the last frame).
			[b]Note:[/b] Since [InputEventMouseMotion] is only emitted when the mouse moves, the last event won't have a relative position of [code]Vector2(0, 0)[/code] when the user stops moving the mouse.
		</member>
		<member name="speed" type="Vector2" setter="set_speed" getter="get_speed" default="Vector2( 0, 0 )">
			The mouse speed in pixels per second.
		</member>
		<member name="tilt" type="Vector2" setter="set_tilt" getter="get_tilt" default="Vector2( 0, 0 )">
			Represents the angles of tilt of the pen. Positive X-coordinate value indicates a tilt to the right. Positive Y-coordinate value indicates a tilt toward the user. Ranges from [code]-1.0[/code] to [code]1.0[/code] for both axes.
