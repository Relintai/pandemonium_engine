	<brief_description>
		Physics Body whose position is determined through physics simulation in 3D space.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		This is the node that implements full 3D physics. This means that you do not control a RigidBody directly. Instead, you can apply forces to it (gravity, impulses, etc.), and the physics simulation will calculate the resulting movement, collision, bouncing, rotating, etc.
		A RigidBody has 4 behavior [member mode]s: Rigid, Static, Character, and Kinematic.
		[b]Note:[/b] Don't change a RigidBody's position every frame or very often. Sporadic changes work fine, but physics runs at a different granularity (fixed Hz) than usual rendering (process callback) and maybe even in a separate thread, so changing this from a process loop may result in strange behavior. If you need to directly affect the body's state, use [method _integrate_forces], which allows you to directly access the physics state.
		If you need to override the default physics behavior, you can write a custom force integration function. See [member custom_integrator].
		With Bullet physics (the default), the center of mass is the RigidBody3D center. With GodotPhysics, the center of mass is the average of the [CollisionShape] centers.
		[b]Warning:[/b] With a non-uniform scale this node will probably not function as expected. Please make sure to keep its scale uniform (i.e. the same on all axes), and change the size(s) of its collision shape(s) instead.

	<methods>
		<method name="_integrate_forces" qualifiers="virtual">
			<return type="void" />
			<argument index="0" name="state" type="PhysicsDirectBodyState" />
			<description>
				Called during physics processing, allowing you to read and safely modify the simulation state for the object. By default, it works in addition to the usual physics behavior, but the [member custom_integrator] property allows you to disable the default behavior and do fully custom force integration for a body.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="add_central_force">
			<return type="void" />
			<argument index="0" name="force" type="Vector3" />
			<description>
				Adds a constant directional force (i.e. acceleration) without affecting rotation.
				This is equivalent to [code]add_force(force, Vector3(0,0,0))[/code].
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="add_force">
			<return type="void" />
			<argument index="0" name="force" type="Vector3" />
			<argument index="1" name="position" type="Vector3" />
			<description>
				Adds a constant directional force (i.e. acceleration).
				The position uses the rotation of the global coordinate system, but is centered at the object's origin.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="add_torque">
			<return type="void" />
			<argument index="0" name="torque" type="Vector3" />
			<description>
				Adds a constant rotational force (i.e. a motor) without affecting position.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="apply_central_impulse">
			<return type="void" />
			<argument index="0" name="impulse" type="Vector3" />
			<description>
				Applies a directional impulse without affecting rotation.
				This is equivalent to [code]apply_impulse(Vector3(0,0,0), impulse)[/code].
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="apply_impulse">
			<return type="void" />
			<argument index="0" name="position" type="Vector3" />
			<argument index="1" name="impulse" type="Vector3" />
			<description>
				Applies a positioned impulse to the body. An impulse is time independent! Applying an impulse every frame would result in a framerate-dependent force. For this reason it should only be used when simulating one-time impacts. The position uses the rotation of the global coordinate system, but is centered at the object's origin.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="apply_torque_impulse">
			<return type="void" />
			<argument index="0" name="impulse" type="Vector3" />
			<description>
				Applies a torque impulse which will be affected by the body mass and shape. This will rotate the body around the [code]impulse[/code] vector passed.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="get_axis_lock" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="bool" />
			<argument index="0" name="axis" type="int" enum="PhysicsServer.BodyAxis" />
			<description>
				Returns [code]true[/code] if the specified linear or rotational axis is locked.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="get_colliding_bodies" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="Array" />
			<description>
				Returns a list of the bodies colliding with this one. Requires [member contact_monitor] to be set to [code]true[/code] and [member contacts_reported] to be set high enough to detect all the collisions.
				[b]Note:[/b] The result of this test is not immediate after moving objects. For performance, list of collisions is updated once per frame and before the physics step. Consider using signals instead.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="get_inverse_inertia_tensor">
			<return type="Basis" />
			<description>
				Returns the inverse inertia tensor basis. This is used to calculate the angular acceleration resulting from a torque applied to the RigidBody.

		</method>
		<method name="set_axis_velocity">
			<return type="void" />
			<argument index="0" name="axis_velocity" type="Vector3" />
			<description>
				Sets an axis velocity. The velocity in the given vector axis will be set as the given vector length. This is useful for jumping behavior.
