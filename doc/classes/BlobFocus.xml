		Prioritizes a region in which to show blob shadows.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		The number of blob shadows that can be shown at one time is limited (for performance reasons).
		The [BlobFocus] node enables the user to set specific areas where the limited number of shadow casters should be prioritized.
		[BlobFocus] might typically be set relative to a [Camera], or attached to a player.
		Where multiple cameras are used, each [Camera] can have its own [BlobFocus].
