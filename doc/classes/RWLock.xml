		A Read Write Lock.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		A Read Write Lock. This is used to synchronize multiple [Thread]s. This guarantees that only one thread can ever acquire the write lock at a time, and gives any number of threads read access in the meantime. An RWLock can be used to protect a critical section; however, be careful to avoid deadlocks.

	<methods>
		<method name="read_lock">
			<return type="void" />
			<description>
				Locks this [RWLock] for read access, blocks until it is unlocked by the current owner.
				[b]Note:[/b] This function returns without blocking if the thread already has ownership of the rwlock.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="read_try_lock">
			<return type="int" enum="Error" />
			<description>
				Tries locking this [RWLock] for read access, but does not block. Returns [constant OK] on success, [constant ERR_BUSY] otherwise.
				[b]Note:[/b] This function returns [constant OK] if the thread already has ownership of the rwlock.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="read_unlock">
			<return type="void" />
			<description>
				Unlocks this [RWLock] for read access, leaving it to other threads.
				[b]Note:[/b] If a thread called [method lock] or [method try_lock] multiple times while already having ownership of the rwlock, it must also call [method unlock] the same number of times in order to unlock it correctly.

		<method name="write_lock">
			<return type="void" />
			<description>
				Locks this [RWLock] for write access, blocks until it is unlocked by the current owner.
				[b]Note:[/b] This function will deadlock if the thread already has ownership of the rwlock!
