"A* (A star) is a computer algorithm that is widely used in pathfinding and "
"graph traversal, the process of plotting short paths among vertices "
"(points), passing through a given set of edges (segments). It enjoys "
"widespread use due to its performance and accuracy. Godot's A* "
"implementation uses points in three-dimensional space and Euclidean "
"distances by default.\n"
"You must add points manually with [method add_point] and create segments "
"manually with [method connect_points]. Then you can test if there is a path "
"between two points with the [method are_points_connected] function, get a "
"path containing indices by [method get_id_path], or one containing actual "
"coordinates with [method get_point_path].\n"
"It is also possible to use non-Euclidean distances. To do so, create a class "
"that extends [code]AStar[/code] and override methods [method _compute_cost] "
"and [method _estimate_cost]. Both take two indices and return a length, as "
"is shown in the following example.\n"
"[codeblock]\n"
"class MyAStar:\n"
"    extends AStar\n"
"\n"
"    func _compute_cost(u, v):\n"
"        return abs(u - v)\n"
"\n"
"    func _estimate_cost(u, v):\n"
"        return min(0, abs(u - v) - 1)\n"
"[/codeblock]\n"
"[method _estimate_cost] should return a lower bound of the distance, i.e. "
"[code]_estimate_cost(u, v) <= _compute_cost(u, v)[/code]. This serves as a "
"hint to the algorithm because the custom [code]_compute_cost[/code] might be "
"computation-heavy. If this is not the case, make [method _estimate_cost] "
"return the same value as [method _compute_cost] to provide the algorithm "
"with the most accurate information.\n"
"If the default [method _estimate_cost] and [method _compute_cost] methods "
"are used, or if the supplied [method _estimate_cost] method returns a lower "
"bound of the cost, then the paths returned by A* will be the lowest-cost "
"paths. Here, the cost of a path equals the sum of the [method _compute_cost] "
"results of all segments in the path multiplied by the [code]weight_scale[/"
"code]s of the endpoints of the respective segments. If the default methods "
"are used and the [code]weight_scale[/code]s of all points are set to "

"This helper class can be used to store [Variant] values on the filesystem "
"using INI-style formatting. The stored values are identified by a section "
"and a key:\n"
"[codeblock]\n"
"[section]\n"
"some_key=42\n"
"string_example=\"Hello World!\"\n"
"a_vector=Vector3( 1, 0, 2 )\n"
"[/codeblock]\n"
"The stored data can be saved to or parsed from a file, though ConfigFile "
"objects can also be used directly without accessing the filesystem.\n"
"The following example shows how to create a simple [ConfigFile] and save it "
"on disk:\n"
"[codeblock]\n"
"# Create new ConfigFile object.\n"
"var config = ConfigFile.new()\n"
"\n"
"# Store some values.\n"
"config.set_value(\"Player1\", \"player_name\", \"Steve\")\n"
"config.set_value(\"Player1\", \"best_score\", 10)\n"
"config.set_value(\"Player2\", \"player_name\", \"V3geta\")\n"
"config.set_value(\"Player2\", \"best_score\", 9001)\n"
"\n"
"# Save it to a file (overwrite if already exists).\n"
"config.save(\"user://scores.cfg\")\n"
"[/codeblock]\n"
"This example shows how the above file could be loaded:\n"
"[codeblock]\n"
"var score_data = {}\n"
"var config = ConfigFile.new()\n"
"\n"
"# Load data from a file.\n"
"var err = config.load(\"user://scores.cfg\")\n"
"\n"
"# If the file didn't load, ignore it.\n"
"if err != OK:\n"
"    return\n"
"\n"
"# Iterate over all sections.\n"
"for player in config.get_sections():\n"
"    # Fetch the data for each section.\n"
"    var player_name = config.get_value(player, \"player_name\")\n"
"    var player_score = config.get_value(player, \"best_score\")\n"
"    score_data[player_name] = player_score\n"
"[/codeblock]\n"
"Any operation that mutates the ConfigFile such as [method set_value], "
"[method clear], or [method erase_section], only changes what is loaded in "
"memory. If you want to write the change to a file, you have to save the "
"changes with [method save], [method save_encrypted], or [method "
"save_encrypted_pass].\n"
"Keep in mind that section and property names can't contain spaces. Anything "
"after a space will be ignored on save and on load.\n"
"ConfigFiles can also contain manually written comment lines starting with a "
"semicolon ([code];[/code]). Those lines will be ignored when parsing the "
"file. Note that comments will be lost when saving the ConfigFile. This can "
"still be useful for dedicated server configuration files, which are "
"typically never overwritten without explicit user action.\n"
"[b]Note:[/b] The file extension given to a ConfigFile does not have any "
"impact on its formatting or behavior. By convention, the [code].cfg[/code] "
"extension is used here, but any other extension such as [code].ini[/code] is "
"also valid. Since neither [code].cfg[/code] nor [code].ini[/code] are "
"standardized, Godot's ConfigFile formatting may differ from files written by "
"other programs."

"This class is responsible for creating and clearing 3D navigation meshes "
"used as [NavigationMesh] resources inside [NavigationMeshInstance]. The "
"[NavigationMeshGenerator] has very limited to no use for 2D as the "
"navigation mesh baking process expects 3D node types and 3D source geometry "
"to parse.\n"
"The entire navigation mesh baking is best done in a separate thread as the "
"voxelization, collision tests and mesh optimization steps involved are very "
"performance and time hungry operations.\n"
"Navigation mesh baking happens in multiple steps and the result depends on "
"3D source geometry and properties of the [NavigationMesh] resource. In the "
"first step, starting from a root node and depending on [NavigationMesh] "
"properties all valid 3D source geometry nodes are collected from the "
"[SceneTree]. Second, all collected nodes are parsed for their relevant 3D "
"geometry data and a combined 3D mesh is build. Due to the many different "
"types of parsable objects, from normal [MeshInstance]s to [CSGShape]s or "
"various [CollisionObject]s, some operations to collect geometry data can "
"trigger [VisualServer] and [PhysicsServer] synchronizations. Server "
"synchronization can have a negative effect on baking time or framerate as it "
"often involves [Mutex] locking for thread security. Many parsable objects "
"and the continuous synchronization with other threaded Servers can increase "
"the baking time significantly. On the other hand only a few but very large "
"and complex objects will take some time to prepare for the Servers which can "
"noticeably stall the next frame render. As a general rule the total amount "
"of parsable objects and their individual size and complexity should be "
"balanced to avoid framerate issues or very long baking times. The combined "
"mesh is then passed to the Recast Navigation Object to test the source "
"geometry for walkable terrain suitable to [NavigationMesh] agent properties "
"by creating a voxel world around the meshes bounding area.\n"
"The finalized navigation mesh is then returned and stored inside the "
"[NavigationMesh] for use as a resource inside [NavigationMeshInstance] "
"nodes.\n"
"[b]Note:[/b] Using meshes to not only define walkable surfaces but also "
"obstruct navigation baking does not always work. The navigation baking has "
"no concept of what is a geometry \"inside\" when dealing with mesh source "

"Nodes are Godot's building blocks. They can be assigned as the child of "
"another node, resulting in a tree arrangement. A given node can contain any "
"number of nodes as children with the requirement that all siblings (direct "
"children of a node) should have unique names.\n"
"A tree of nodes is called a [i]scene[/i]. Scenes can be saved to the disk "
"and then instanced into other scenes. This allows for very high flexibility "
"in the architecture and data model of Godot projects.\n"
"[b]Scene tree:[/b] The [SceneTree] contains the active tree of nodes. When a "
"node is added to the scene tree, it receives the [constant "
"NOTIFICATION_ENTER_TREE] notification and its [method _enter_tree] callback "
"is triggered. Child nodes are always added [i]after[/i] their parent node, i."
"e. the [method _enter_tree] callback of a parent node will be triggered "
"before its child's.\n"
"Once all nodes have been added in the scene tree, they receive the [constant "
"NOTIFICATION_READY] notification and their respective [method _ready] "
"callbacks are triggered. For groups of nodes, the [method _ready] callback "
"is called in reverse order, starting with the children and moving up to the "
"parent nodes.\n"
"This means that when adding a node to the scene tree, the following order "
"will be used for the callbacks: [method _enter_tree] of the parent, [method "
"_enter_tree] of the children, [method _ready] of the children and finally "
"[method _ready] of the parent (recursively for the entire scene tree).\n"
"[b]Processing:[/b] Nodes can override the \"process\" state, so that they "
"receive a callback on each frame requesting them to process (do something). "
"Normal processing (callback [method _process], toggled with [method "
"set_process]) happens as fast as possible and is dependent on the frame "
"rate, so the processing time [i]delta[/i] (in seconds) is passed as an "
"argument. Physics processing (callback [method _physics_process], toggled "
"with [method set_physics_process]) happens a fixed number of times per "
"second (60 by default) and is useful for code related to the physics "
"engine.\n"
"Nodes can also process input events. When present, the [method _input] "
"function will be called for each input that the program receives. In many "
"cases, this can be overkill (unless used for simple projects), and the "
"[method _unhandled_input] function might be preferred; it is called when the "
"input event was not handled by anyone else (typically, GUI [Control] nodes), "
"ensuring that the node only receives the events that were meant for it.\n"
"To keep track of the scene hierarchy (especially when instancing scenes into "
"other scenes), an \"owner\" can be set for the node with the [member owner] "
"property. This keeps track of who instanced what. This is mostly useful when "
"writing editors and tools, though.\n"
"Finally, when a node is freed with [method Object.free] or [method "
"queue_free], it will also free all its children.\n"
"[b]Groups:[/b] Nodes can be added to as many groups as you want to be easy "
"to manage, you could create groups like \"enemies\" or \"collectables\" for "
"example, depending on your game. See [method add_to_group], [method "
"is_in_group] and [method remove_from_group]. You can then retrieve all nodes "
"in these groups, iterate them and even call methods on groups via the "
"methods on [SceneTree].\n"
"[b]Networking with nodes:[/b] After connecting to a server (or making one, "
"see [NetworkedMultiplayerENet]), it is possible to use the built-in RPC "
"(remote procedure call) system to communicate over the network. By calling "
"[method rpc] with a method name, it will be called locally and in all "
"connected peers (peers = clients and the server that accepts connections). "
"To identify which node receives the RPC call, Godot will use its [NodePath] "
"(make sure node names are the same on all peers). Also, take a look at the "
"high-level networking tutorial and corresponding demos."

"distance_squared_to].\n"
"[ProximityGroup] nodes are automatically grouped together, as long as they "
"share the same [member group_name] and intersect with each other. By calling "
"the [method broadcast], you can invoke a specified method with various "
"parameters to all intersecting members.\n"
"[ProximityGroup] is cuboid-shaped and consists of a cluster of [Vector3] "
"coordinates. The coordinates are automatically calculated by calling [member "
"grid_radius]. To allow [ProximityGroup] to find its peers (and perform "
"automatic grouping), you need to define its [member group_name] to a non-"
"empty [String]. As soon as this object's shape intersects with another "
"[ProximityGroup] object' shape, and both share the same [member group_name], "
"they will belong together for as long as they intersect.\n"
"Since [ProximityGroup] doesn't rely the physics engine, you don't need to "
"add any other node as a child (unlike [PhysicsBody]).\n"
"The [ProximityGroup] uses the [SceneTree] groups in the background by "
"calling the method [method Node.add_to_group] internally. The [SceneTree] "
"group names are constructed by combining the [member group_name] with its "
"coordinates, which are calculated using the [member grid_radius] you defined "
"beforehand.\n"
"[b]Example:[/b] A [ProximityGroup] node named [code]\"PlanetEarth\"[/code] "
"at position [code]Vector3(6, 6, 6)[/code] with a [member group_name] set to "
"[code]\"planets\"[/code] and a [member grid_radius] of [code]Vector3(1, 2, 3)"

"[codeblock]\n"
"- \"planets|5|4|3\"\n"
"- \"planets|5|4|4\"\n"
"- \"planets|5|4|5\"\n"

"- \"planets|5|4|8\"\n"

"[code]Vector3(5, 4, 7)[/code], it would normally create the [SceneTree] "
"group called [code]\"planets|5|4|7\"[/code]. However, since this group name "
"already exists, this [ProximityGroup] object will be [i]added[/i] to the "
"existing one. [code]\"PlanetEarth\"[/code] is already in this group. As long "
"as both nodes don't change their transform and stop intersecting (or exit "
"the scene tree), they are grouped together. As long as this intersection "
"exists, any call to [method broadcast] will affect [i]both[/i] "
"[ProximityGroup] nodes.\n"
"There are 3 caveats to keep in mind when using [ProximityGroup]:\n"
"- The larger the grid radius, the more coordinates and the more [SceneTree] "
"groups are created. This can have a performance impact if too many groups "
"are created.\n"
"- If the [ProximityGroup] node is transformed in any way (or is removed from "
"the scene tree), the groupings will have to be recalculated. This can also "
"have a performance impact.\n"
"- If your [member grid_radius] is smaller than [code]Vector3(1, 1, 1)[/"
"code], it will be rounded up to [code]Vector3(1, 1, 1)[/code]. Therefore, "
"small grid radius values may lead to unwanted groupings.\n"
"[b]Note:[/b] [ProximityGroup] will be removed in Godot 4.0 in favor of more "
"effective and faster [VisibilityNotifier] functionality. For most use cases, "
"[method Vector3.distance_to] or [method Vector3.distance_squared_to] are "

"First it goes through every [Room] that is a child of the [code]room list[/"

"[code]room graph[/code].\n"
"This works for both [Room] nodes, and [Spatial] nodes that follow a special "
"naming convention. They should begin with the prefix [i]'Room_'[/i], "
"followed by the name you wish to give the room, e.g. [i]'Room_lounge'[/i]. "
"This will automatically convert such [Spatial]s to [Room] nodes for you. "
"This is useful if you want to build you entire room system in e.g. Blender, "
"and reimport multiple times as you work on the level.\n"
"The conversion will try to assign [VisualInstance]s that are children and "
"grandchildren of the [Room] to the room. These should be given a suitable "
"[code]portal mode[/code] (see the [CullInstance] documentation). The default "
"[code]portal mode[/code] is [code]STATIC[/code] - objects which are not "
"expected to move while the level is played, which will typically be most "
"objects.\n"
"The conversion will usually use the geometry of these [VisualInstance]s (and "
"the [Portal]s) to calculate a convex hull bound for the room. These bounds "
"will be shown in the editor with a wireframe. Alternatively you can specify "
"a manual custom bound for any room, see the [Room] documentation.\n"
"By definition, [Camera]s within a room can see everything else within the "
"room (that is one advantage to using convex hulls). However, in order to see "
"from one room into adjacent rooms, you must place [Portal]s, which represent "
"openings that the camera can see through, like windows and doors.\n"
"[Portal]s are really just specialized [MeshInstance]s. In fact you will "
"usually first create a portal by creating a [MeshInstance], especially a "
"[code]plane[/code] mesh instance. You would move the plane in the editor to "
"cover a window or doorway, with the front face pointing outward from the "
"room. To let the conversion process know you want this mesh to be a portal, "
"again we use a special naming convention. [MeshInstance]s to be converted to "
"a [Portal] should start with the prefix [i]'Portal_'[/i].\n"
"You now have a choice - you can leave the name as [i]'Portal_'[/i] and allow "
"the system to automatically detect the nearest [Room] to link. In most cases "
"this will work fine.\n"
"An alternative method is to specify the [Room] to link to manually, "
"appending a suffix to the portal name, which should be the name of the room "
"you intend to link to. For example [i]'Portal_lounge'[/i] will attempt to "
"link to the room named [i]'Room_lounge'[/i].\n"
"There is a special case here - Godot does not allow two nodes to share the "
"same name. What if you want to manually have more than one portal leading "
"into the same room? Surely they will need to both be called, e.g. "
"[i]'Portal_lounge'[/i]?\n"
"The solution is a wildcard character. After the room name, if you use the "
"character [i]'*'[/i], this character and anything following it will be "
"ignored. So you can use for example [i]'Portal_lounge*0'[/i], "

"[SceneTreeTween] is a tween managed by the scene tree. As opposed to "
"[Tween], it does not require the instantiation of a node.\n"
"[SceneTreeTween]s are more light-weight than [AnimationPlayer], so they are "
"very much suited for simple animations or general tasks that don't require "
"visual tweaking provided by the editor. They can be used in a fire-and-"
"forget manner for some logic that normally would be done by code. You can e."
"g. make something shoot periodically by using a looped [CallbackTweener] "
"with a delay.\n"
"A [SceneTreeTween] can be created by using either [method SceneTree."
"create_tween] or [method Node.create_tween]. [SceneTreeTween]s created "
"manually (i.e. by using [code]Tween.new()[/code]) are invalid. They can't be "
"used for tweening values, but you can do manual interpolation with [method "
"interpolate_value].\n"
"A tween animation is created by adding [Tweener]s to the [SceneTreeTween] "
"object, using [method tween_property], [method tween_interval], [method "
"tween_callback] or [method tween_method]:\n"
"[codeblock]\n"
"var tween = get_tree().create_tween()\n"
"tween.tween_property($Sprite, \"modulate\", Color.red, 1)\n"
"tween.tween_property($Sprite, \"scale\", Vector2(), 1)\n"
"tween.tween_callback($Sprite, \"queue_free\")\n"
"[/codeblock]\n"
"This sequence will make the [code]$Sprite[/code] node turn red, then shrink, "
"before finally calling [method Node.queue_free] to free the sprite. "
"[Tweener]s are executed one after another by default. This behavior can be "
"changed using [method parallel] and [method set_parallel].\n"
"When a [Tweener] is created with one of the [code]tween_*[/code] methods, a "
"chained method call can be used to tweak the properties of this [Tweener]. "
"For example, if you want to set a different transition type in the above "
"example, you can use [method set_trans]:\n"
"[codeblock]\n"
"var tween = get_tree().create_tween()\n"
"tween.tween_property($Sprite, \"modulate\", Color.red, 1).set_trans(Tween."
"TRANS_SINE)\n"
"tween.tween_property($Sprite, \"scale\", Vector2(), 1).set_trans(Tween."
"TRANS_BOUNCE)\n"
"tween.tween_callback($Sprite, \"queue_free\")\n"
"[/codeblock]\n"
"Most of the [SceneTreeTween] methods can be chained this way too. In the "
"following example the [SceneTreeTween] is bound to the running script's node "
"and a default transition is set for its [Tweener]s:\n"
"[codeblock]\n"
"var tween = get_tree().create_tween().bind_node(self).set_trans(Tween."
"TRANS_ELASTIC)\n"
"tween.tween_property($Sprite, \"modulate\", Color.red, 1)\n"
"tween.tween_property($Sprite, \"scale\", Vector2(), 1)\n"
"tween.tween_callback($Sprite, \"queue_free\")\n"
"[/codeblock]\n"
"Another interesting use for [SceneTreeTween]s is animating arbitrary sets of "
"objects:\n"
"[codeblock]\n"
"var tween = create_tween()\n"
"for sprite in get_children():\n"
"    tween.tween_property(sprite, \"position\", Vector2(0, 0), 1)\n"
"[/codeblock]\n"
"In the example above, all children of a node are moved one after another to "
"position (0, 0).\n"
"You should avoid using more than one [SceneTreeTween] per object's property. "
"If two or more tweens animate one property at the same time, the last one "
"created will take priority and assign the final value. If you want to "
"interrupt and restart an animation, consider assigning the [SceneTreeTween] "
"to a variable:\n"
"[codeblock]\n"
"var tween\n"
"func animate():\n"
"    if tween:\n"
"        tween.kill() # Abort the previous animation.\n"
"    tween = create_tween()\n"
"[/codeblock]\n"
"Some [Tweener]s use transitions and eases. The first accepts a [enum Tween."
"TransitionType] constant, and refers to the way the timing of the animation "
"is handled (see [url=https://easings.net/]easings.net[/url] for some "
"examples). The second accepts an [enum Tween.EaseType] constant, and "
"controls where the [code]trans_type[/code] is applied to the interpolation "
"(in the beginning, the end, or both). If you don't know which transition and "
"easing to pick, you can try different [enum Tween.TransitionType] constants "
"with [constant Tween.EASE_IN_OUT], and use the one that looks best.\n"

"Tweens are useful for animations requiring a numerical property to be "
"interpolated over a range of values. The name [i]tween[/i] comes from [i]in-"
"betweening[/i], an animation technique where you specify [i]keyframes[/i] "
"and the computer interpolates the frames that appear between them.\n"
"[Tween] is more suited than [AnimationPlayer] for animations where you don't "
"know the final values in advance. For example, interpolating a dynamically-"
"chosen camera zoom value is best done with a [Tween] node; it would be "
"difficult to do the same thing with an [AnimationPlayer] node.\n"
"Here is a brief usage example that makes a 2D node move smoothly between two "
"positions:\n"
"[codeblock]\n"
"var tween = get_node(\"Tween\")\n"
"tween.interpolate_property($Node2D, \"position\",\n"
"        Vector2(0, 0), Vector2(100, 100), 1,\n"
"        Tween.TRANS_LINEAR, Tween.EASE_IN_OUT)\n"
"tween.start()\n"
"[/codeblock]\n"
"Many methods require a property name, such as [code]\"position\"[/code] "
"above. You can find the correct property name by hovering over the property "
"in the Inspector. You can also provide the components of a property directly "
"by using [code]\"property:component\"[/code] (e.g. [code]position:x[/code]), "
"where it would only apply to that particular component.\n"
"Many of the methods accept [code]trans_type[/code] and [code]ease_type[/"
"code]. The first accepts an [enum TransitionType] constant, and refers to "
"the way the timing of the animation is handled (see [url=https://easings."
"net/]easings.net[/url] for some examples). The second accepts an [enum "
"EaseType] constant, and controls where the [code]trans_type[/code] is "
"applied to the interpolation (in the beginning, the end, or both). If you "
"don't know which transition and easing to pick, you can try different [enum "
"TransitionType] constants with [constant EASE_IN_OUT], and use the one that "
"looks best.\n"

"[b]Terminology:[/b] In the context of UPnP networking, \"gateway\" (or "
"\"internet gateway device\", short IGD) refers to network devices that allow "
"computers in the local network to access the internet (\"wide area "
"network\", WAN). These gateways are often also called \"routers\".\n"
"[b]Pitfalls:[/b]\n"
"- As explained above, these calls are blocking and shouldn't be run on the "
"main thread, especially as they can block for multiple seconds at a time. "
"Use threading!\n"
"- Networking is physical and messy. Packets get lost in transit or get "
"filtered, addresses, free ports and assigned mappings change, and devices "
"may leave or join the network at any time. Be mindful of this, be diligent "
"when checking and handling errors, and handle these gracefully if you can: "
"add clear error UI, timeouts and re-try handling.\n"
"- Port mappings may change (and be removed) at any time, and the remote/"
"external IP address of the gateway can change likewise. You should consider "
"re-querying the external IP and try to update/refresh the port mapping "
"periodically (for example, every 5 minutes and on networking failures).\n"
"- Not all devices support UPnP, and some users disable UPnP support. You "
"need to handle this (e.g. documenting and requiring the user to manually "
"forward ports, or adding alternative methods of NAT traversal, like a relay/"
"mirror server, or NAT hole punching, STUN/TURN, etc.).\n"
"- Consider what happens on mapping conflicts. Maybe multiple users on the "
"same network would like to play your game at the same time, or maybe another "
"application uses the same port. Make the port configurable, and optimally "
"choose a port automatically (re-trying with a different port on failure).\n"
