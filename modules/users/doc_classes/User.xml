	<description>
		Represents a User account in your application.
		Can be extended using both inheritance and [UserModule]s. [UserModule]s are more dynamic compared to inheritance, but they can also be made always available. 
		Since applications need to be able to create [User] classes from multiple places, and both their setup and their storage can get very involved, this is handled by [UserDB] and [UserManager]s. This also means means, that:
		- Always create them using [method UserDB.create_user], to get a proper subclass with the proper [UserModule] setup that your application expects.
		User accounts (due to their nature) might need to be used in a heavily concurent environment. The web module is a perfect example of this. Due to this, internally they have an [RWLock] and they provide an api so it can be controlled from the outside.
		Please note that [RWLock]s are not re-entrant! This means that the same thread cannot lock it more than once! This also means that this class can't automatically close it's own lock. (Note that similar classes work the same way.)
		In Essence:
		- Always close locks when doing more than one operations on them at once.
		- Always close the locks for writes.
		- Sometimes you can get away with not read locking when doing single reads.
		- You can ignore using locks if you don't use threading.
		Note that When handling concurrency with these types of classes, preserving atomicity is the most important. Imagine that you are running a multithreaded web application, and 2 users try to edit the same resource at the same time. What you don't want is to end up with data that is interwoven of the two different requests. (If you don't want to lose an edit due to this, build a changelog feature for that specific class.)

	<methods>
		<method name="_check_password" qualifiers="virtual">
			<return type="bool" />
			<argument index="0" name="password" type="String" />
			<description>
				Checks whether a supplied password matches the stored one.
				[method check_password] calls this.
				By default it calls [method hash_password] and checks whether it matches the stored hash.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="_create_password" qualifiers="virtual">
			<return type="void" />
			<argument index="0" name="password" type="String" />
			<description>
				Sets up internal data from the given password string.
				[method create_password] calls this.
				By default it will set up pre and post salt, and then create the final password hash using [method hash_password]. Set up everything that your [method hash_password] implementation needs in this method.
				Note: Do not store passwords. Ever. Always use hashes, because they are directly irreversible. Unfortunately this doesn't mean they are immune to being cracked. Actually reversing them is done by trying lots of inputs until one hashes to the same value. Since this takes lots of processing power it's worth to precalculate these [code]key - hash[/code] pairs for all combinations under a certain string length threshold. So salting passwords (adding characters to them) is recommended to make them longer before generating the final hash to make these (rainbow) tables unusable. Also don't use hashes that are considered insecure for this specific use case by the standards of the time. (Don't use md5!)
