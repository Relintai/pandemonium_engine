	<description>
		The WebServer class can be used as a base for Webserver implementations.
		When the actual server implementation receives an HTTP request it needs to take it's [WebServerRequest] implementation, set it up properly, then it needs to call the [code]server_handle_request()[/code] method with it, to start handling it.
		It sould have one [WebNode] (or a derived class) as a child, it will be set as the web root. If you add more than one, only the first one will be used. Requests will be sent to this [WebNode]'s [code]handle_request_main()[/code].
		If a [HTTPSessionManager] is added as a child, it will be picked up automatically, and then it can be used by [WebNodes]s to store session information.

		<method name="request_write_lock">
			<return type="void" />
			<description>
				Request a write lock, in order to be able to change your active [WebNode] tree. Actually change the tree in _notification, when you receive NOTIFICATION_WEB_SERVER_WRITE_LOCK_ACQUIRED.
				Note that HTTP servers are highly asynchronous, and due to how the system works adding and even removing [WebNode]s from the tree is not that big of a deal, however deallocating [WebNode]s while they are processing requests will crash your app sooner or later. Just to be safe I recommended that you lock your [WebNode] tree branch before touching it.
				Do not forget to make your nodes refresh their internal handler map when you change the tree using other helper methods like build_handler_map().
