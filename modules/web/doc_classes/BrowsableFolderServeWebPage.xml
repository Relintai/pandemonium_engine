		The [BrowsableFolderServeWebPage] class adds folder listing functionality on top of [FolderServeWebPage]. Fundamentally it's the same as the Apache webserver's directory listing.
		As an example let's take this folder:
		[code]content_folder/
		-- ct/
		---- ctf.jpg
		-- file1.md
		-- test.jpg[/code]
		A [FolderServeWebPage] is pointed to the [code]content_folder[/code] folder, it's set as a child of a [WebRoot], and it's uri segment is [code]served_files[/code]:
		[code]Opening: http://127.0.0.1/served_files will send a generated html directory listing.
		Opening: http://127.0.0.1/served_files/file1.md will send page1.md.
		Opening: http://127.0.0.1/served_files/test.jpg will send page2.md.
		Opening: http://127.0.0.1/served_files/ct will send a generated html directory listing.
		Opening: http://127.0.0.1/served_files/ct/ctf.jpg will send ctf.jpg.[/code]
