		Groups together tile map layers as part or the same map, replacing the [LayeredTileMap] node. Child layers will use this node's [member tile_set].
		The editor also uses [LayeredTileMapLayerGroup] as a way to store which layers are selected in a given group. This allows highlighting the currently selected layers.
