### Added

#### Engine

- Backport text-to-speech support.

#### Modules

##### Procedural Tree 3D

- New Procedural Tree 3D Module. Adds a new 'ProceduralTreeMesh' Mesh class that can generate trees procedurally. It uses https://github.com/jarikomppa/proctree .

#### Release

- Now the releases include a gdnative headers zip.
- Reworked the copy_repos script to use git locally to make a copy from the local engine tree.
- Copy gdnative headers helper script.

### Fixed

- Only keep one of the doc links in the editor's help menu.
- Updated the engine license in the EditorAbout window.
- Merge pull request from halotroop2288: Separate statements about Godot and Pandemonium in README

### Removed

- Removed feature profile dir creation from the editor.
- Removed the support development option from the help menu.
- Removed the donors tab from the EditorAbout window, as I'm not even trying to take donations anymore.

### Backports

- Backported everything up to and including https://github.com/godotengine/godot/commit/0ccd559d176b5e0d0c72128c382b6cad525438c2 Merge commit: https://github.com/godotengine/godot/commit/8c444fb9c9ed70306630ebaf4868a6629df1296c

#### Godot 3.x

- `Object::call()` prevent debug lock accessing dangling pointer
  Self deleting an object within a call was leading to crashes due to referencing freed memory, due to a raw pointer stored in the debug lock.
- Fix parsing of `4.` in Expression
- Backported: Doctool: Remove version attribute from XML header. We don't use that info for anything, 
  and it generates unnecessary diffs every time we bump the minor version (and CI failures if we forget 
  to sync some files from opt-in modules (mono, text_server_fb).
- Safe `Camera::unproject_position()`
  `unproject_position()` can fail in some circumstances, and this needs to be conveyed to calling code.
- PopupMenu: Update margins on visibility change Fixes #96149.
- Verify GLTF indices to prevent crash with corrupt files
  Also verify prior to vertex optimization.
- GLTF: Fixed external images getting embedded on import
  Added a map to keep track of external images during import, and used
  that map to instance the textures using the resource loader instead of
  creating a new texture from scratch

## [4.4.0]

Highlights:

- Tweaks to editor defaults.
- Added back lightmaps, gpu based particles (GPUParticle) and GIProbes.
- Added back the gles3 renderer (can be turned off compile time).
- LayeredTileMaps got VertexLight2D management, and navigation obstacle support.
- Implemented prepared statements for the database module.
- The markdown renderer is now scriptable.

Breaking changes:

- Always defer unmatched requests in WebNodes to index nodes if they are available.
- Tweak WebNode::get_full_uri() to give back the output what you'd normally assume when the uri segment is "/" under a WebRoot.
- Renamed the render_menu property in UserWebPage to should_render_menu, as there is a render_menu method in WebNode.
- Don't create any accounts by default in the UserManagerDB::_create_default_entries() virtual method.

##### Web

- Always defer unmatched requests to index nodes if they are available.
- Expose FileCache in FolderServeWebPage to scripts.
- Tweak WebNode::get_full_uri() to give back the output what you'd normally assume when the uri segment is "/" under a WebRoot.

### Backports

- Backported everything up to and including https://github.com/godotengine/godot/commit/1cf50364c116acab4f86b70c2fd559475d60e198 Merge commit: https://github.com/godotengine/godot/commit/2cc5ca43ef68382c94d963bd9336ad8efea6adae

#### Godot3

- Backported: [CI] Upload build cache before running tests. - AThousandShips https://github.com/godotengine/godot/commit/078210bce16b9d7e4109db938560ad17c28a10c7
- Fix `PopupMenu` size calculations not taking into account control/canvas scale
- fix lost old callback when continuous call requestRenderAndNotify
- Backport DirectionalLight `fade_start` property to `3.x`:
  Implement shadow fading when using the Orthogonal shadow mode (like in `master`).
  This allows customizing the distance at which directional shadows start to fade away. Shadow fading will also always start at the same distance now, regardless of the current shadow mode in use.
  This is useful for enclosed levels to prevent shadows from fading at all with a well-tuned maximum distance.
  The default fade start value (0.8) results in fading happening later in the distance compared to the previous behavior, where fading started from the last shadow split distance (0.6 in PSSM 4 Splits and 0.1 in PSSM 2 Splits).
- Fix physics tick count in `Input.action_press` and `Input.action_release` The physics tick count was not yet updated there.
- Use unztell64 in FileAccessZIP to ensure 64 bit return (cherry picked from commit efccebd3db90d7baf0947cd02612ab987ab87868)
- doc: Fix cherry-pick mistake for Vector3.cross description
- Add POST_NOTIFICATIONS permission to the list of permissions available in the Export dialog (cherry picked from commit 739190ca2b7f1b67a78eff33154a4bfd1964f5c4)
- Clarify the behavior of `Vector2/3.cross` and mention parallel vectors (cherry picked from commit 47a8033698b14c8a7bb25867198c1371382e3398)
- Always look for unique node names in owner if not found in owned nodes (cherry picked from commit 95ced4bbdcea4d8e225e235fc120c4ebd72f443d)
- Enabled secure restorable state. (cherry picked from commit 84380a94f776c8c1e7786d2eb3fb811789f42639)
- miniupnpc: Disable socket timeout on Windows, matching upstream Fixes #88471. (cherry picked from commit f695de7c68e373088175f8f3b1650f11a27be7aa)
- Add support for PCK embedding section with non GNU-ld linkers. (cherry picked from commit 625c4bdacef4173f94200632362e25e537ad5d21)
- Physics Interpolation - refactor client interpolation pump
  * Move client interpolation pump to earlier in the iteration before 3D physics synced
  * Allow `get_global_transform_interpolated()` to prime the client interpolation inside a physics tick
- Physics Interpolation - refactor `Camera` and fix `get_camera_transform()`
  * Moves 3D Camera interpolation scene side.
  * Automatically switches `get_camera_transform()` to report interpolated transform during `_process()`.
  * Fixes `ClippedCamera` to work with physics interpolation.
- Physics Interpolation - Fix 2D skinning
  2D skinning required the interpolated skeleton base transform to be updated when using interpolation.
- Fix `spatial_editor_plugin` enum
  * The `view_mesh_stats` feature introduced a new enum value `VIEW_SLECTED_INFO` within the unnamed `VIEW` enum.
  * This turns out to be saved somehow, which means the view settings can get out of sync when reloading the project in an older version of the editor.
  * The solution is simply to move the new value to the end of the enum so there are no conflicts.
- Editor 3D view mesh stats
  Similar to information window, add a small optional window to display face count and other stats.
- Add IME input support.
- Add support for privacy manifest configuration.
- Extend iOS plugins to support Swift runtime

- Physics interpolation - Zero server side multimesh data To prevent possibility of use of uninitialized data.
- Tighter light culling - fix directional lights colinear case Exactly the same fix as done already for non-directional lights.
- Don't define NO_EDITOR_SPLASH in export templates
- Fix typo in @GlobalScope.xml "inteters" instead of "integers"
- Fix long category name display in Inspector
- Fix Viewport interpolation mode Viewport interpolation mode is a special case, which should be set to ON instead of INHERIT.
- Physics Interpolation - Fix `VisualInstance::set_instance_use_identity_transform()` The logic for updating the `VisualServer` with the transform was the wrong way around.
- Fix fragcolor write locations in scene shaders
- Tight shadow culling - increase epsilon to prevent flickering Near colinear triangles were still causing inaccuracy in culling planes, so the threshold for colinearity is bumped up.
- Fix theme item parameter completion
- SCons: Fix Windows/MinGW TypeError with recent SCons Fixes #86484.
- Add range hint for ViewportContainer.stretch_shrink
- GDNative: Fix Linux riscv warning about ignored `sysv_abi`
- Optimize Editor `_init_grid()` Use static `LocalVectors` instead of `PoolVectors` for temporaries.
- ImageTexture - document workaround for mipmap generation

- Fix type hints in GLTFDocumentExtension virtual methods
- Fix TabContainer not updating content rect after toggling tab icon
- Backport fix documentation about body_shape_index
- FIXED: Locale fallback selector doesn't appear in project options.
- Tilemap editor - prevent changing tool when mouse buttons pressed 
  Changing tool when painting prevented the corresponding commit of undo action when the mouse button was released. This led to undo actions getting out of sync and the undo system breaking the editor.
  This PR simply prevents changing tool while mouse buttons are pressed, and prevents the above scenario.
- Allow LSP to process multiple messages per poll (cherry-picked from commit e2485044a1b33628e6149d4f930b6fe065743c9d)


## [4.3.0]

Highlights:

- Backported the new TileMap from Godot4. Every class from it has been prefixed with the word `Layered`, so look for the `LayeredTileMap` class. The old `TileMap` is still available without any breakages.
- Created a new VertexLights2D module.
- Created a new VertexLights3D module.
- Better LOD support due to a change from godot3.x.
- Backported PROPERTY_USAGE_ARRAY from Godot 4.
- Fixed, set up exporter and export templates for the FRT and FRT SDL platforms (it's for `SBC`s).
- Fixed IOS export template .
- Now WebServerSimple can also use temporary files for uploads.
- Added a simple HTML Templating solution. See the HTMLTemplate and HTMLTemplateData classes and [this demo](https://github.com/Relintai/pandemonium_demo_projects/tree/master/web/users_sqlite_bootstrap_templated).
- Build containers and release setup rework.
- ... and many more 

Breaking changes:

- Android dependencies had to be updated, unfortunately this raises the required java version to 17. On the flip side hovewer there is a new editor java home setting, and also the JAVA_HOME environment variable gets picked up.
- Build containers now use docker instead of podman.
- Removed parse_files() from WebServerRequest. It's doesn't work well with how the http protocol works. It did not do anything. If you called it just remove that call.

### Added

- Added FRT and FRT SDL build containers.
- New icon for frt sdl.
- Added an exporter for frt_sdl.
- Added a separate exporter for FRT.
- Added entity_resource_base_world_speed property to the ESS singleton.
- Also add is_zero_approx() to Vector4.
- Added copy pose and paste pose tools to the skeleton editor. Also added separators to it's dropdown menu.
- Make RAO and VertexLights2D work with the new LayeredTileMap setup.
- Created a new VertexLights2D module.
- Created a new VertexLights3D module.
- Added exp2 to the Math singleton.
- Added Material and merger support for PropDataMergeGroup.
- Added Material support for PropDataProp.
- Added a new PropDataMergeGroup Node for props.
- Implemented RAO for LayeredTileMaps.
- Added a new canvas_item_add_texture_rect_animation() method to the RenderingServer.
- Proper docs for WebServerSimple.
- Updated docs for FileCache.
- Added optional force parameter to WebServerRequest::move_file(). Also various fixes and improvements to the new upload temp file system.
- Added new wwwroot_get_simplified_abs_path() helper to FileCache. Also improved the other path helper methods.
- Now WebServerSimple can also use temporary files for uploads.
- Added move_file() and is_file_moved()  helper methods to WebServerRequest.
- Added docs for String::substr_index().
- Added more file formats to the Text Editor's Save Dialog.
- Added HTMLTemplate and HTMLTemplateData classes.
- Added a new method to Expression so it can be used with multiple threads simultenously.

### Fixed

- Fix crossbuilding libtheora on the server platform.
- Fixed building FRT.
- Fixed building FRT SDL.
- IOS build scripts.
- Fix MMImage.
- Hide the FileSystemDock's empty dock slot when it's in bottom bar mode by default.
- Use internal process for updating a dirty skeleton instead of the MessageQueue. This fixes BoneAttachments being a frame late.
- Sync NativeScript's PROPERTY_USAGE flags with Object's.
- Fix 2d mesh transforms and colors.
- Various doc fixes.
- Fix 2 off-by-one errors.
- Fix incorrect clipping in String::substr_index().
- Use String's length() instead of size().
- Fix class link in the docs for SMTPClient.

### Changed

- Moved the old frt build containers.
- Renamed the build container folders.
- Renamed uwp's exporter's folder so it's not in the editor while that platform cannot yet be built.
- Reworked the build containers and the in-container build scripts.
- Added an exported for the server platform.
- In-container build script cleanups.
- Build containers now use docker instead of podman.
- Updated the build containers based on godot's.
- Now the input_properties and output_properties property won't get saved directly in MMNode (this was the original intent, nothing should change other than MMMaterial files should be a bit smaller now.). They are still visible in the editor.  Also make sure an MMNodeUniversalProperty can only be registered once.
- Make mat maker's image picker button's dialog use resources.
- Fix error found by static analysis tools.
- Improved Light setup in PropInstance.
- Added more properties to PropDataLight and other light helper classes.
- Now CharacterSkeleton2D inherits from YSort. It disables sorting by default, so the default behaviour won't change.
- Now tooltips won't get scaled to their original control's scale anymore by default. Added a new gui_scale_tooltips property to Viewport to be able to use the previous behaviour when it's desired.
- Removed clips_input() method and _clips_input() virtual method from Control. Made clip_contents to also have an input clipping effect, since I couldn't think any single instance where keeping them separated would be useful. This fixes LayeredTileMap's editors clipping input while being invisible, and likely other smaller issues.
- Now EditorPropertyEnums can be setup multiple times.
- Improve multipart filename handling a bit.
- Now SimpleWebServerRequest Only count request size when not writing to a file.
- get_file_length() in WebServerRequest now returns uint64_t.
- Updated sample module_config.py.
- Use bitshifts for all property usage flags.
- Use PROPERTY_HINT_BUTTON in UserManagerStatic instead of a bool.
- Now PROPERTY_HINT_BUTTON adds the property's name as the called method's first parameter.

### Removed

- Removed parse_files() from WebServerRequest. It's doesn't work well with how the http protocol works.
- Removed Vector2i(Vector2) constructor, added a Vector2i conversion operator to Vector2 instead. This solves ambigous Variant to Vector2i conversion errors.

### Backports

- Backported everything up to and including https://github.com/godotengine/godot/commit/90cf873979a0e5b13a2cbc97eb077ee9266e48a5 Merge commit: https://github.com/godotengine/godot/commit/a73715cf55d6709655ae9563e0f6e4f4b12b9955

#### Godot3

- Fix AudioStreamPlayer not paused on pause mode change Fixes #58543.
- Add option to toggle visibility of position gizmos in 2D editor.
- Portals - defer setting active in `VisualServer` until enter tree `set_portal_active()` was being called loading packed scenes prior to entering the tree, visual server portals had not been fully created at this point hence the call was being ignored with an error flagged. This PR defers the call until after entering the tree.
- Add option `modules_enabled_by_default` and minimal CI build.
- Fix physics on_floor_body crash Physics body previously stored the RID of a collision object and accessed it on the next frame, leading to a crash if the object had been deleted. This PR stores the ObjectID in addition to the RID, and checks the object still exists prior to access.
- Store ObjectID instead of pointer for KinematicCollision owner
- Fix SceneTree not respecting virtual process methods
- Don't error multiple times when trying to load missing default bus layout
- Backported Update Android dependencies for the project
  Update Java version from 11 to 17
  Update Android gradle plugin version from 7.2.1 to 8.2.0
  Update gradle version from 7.4.2 to 8.2
  Update target SDK from 33 to 34
  Update build tools version from 33.0.2 to 34.0.0
  Update kotlin version from 1.7.0 to 1.9.20
  Update Android fragment version from 1.3.6 to 1.6.2
  Update AndroidX window version from 1.0.0 to 1.2.0

  m4gr3d
  https://github.com/godotengine/godot/commit/eba77be573793243a91322c7eb8e345695c3b813
  Unfortunately this raises the required java version to 17. On the flip side hovewer there is a new editor java home setting, and also the JAVA_HOME environment variable gets picked up.
- Add is_zero_approx methods to Vector{2,3}
- Check duplicate keys in dictionary literals: enums and const variables
  Check identifiers (const variables and unnamed enums) and named
  enums when parsing dictionary literals whether the keys are not
  duplicated.
  In case of duplicate key is encountered, highlight the line with it 
  and print error message:
  `Duplicate key "foo" found in Dictionary literal`
  This commit is a logical continuation of the commit dab73c7 which
  implemented such checks only for literal keys (which fixed #7034).
  Apart from that, this commit also fixes the issue with the error
  message itself, which was shown one line below the duplicated key
  in case it was the last one in the dictionary literal and there
  was no hanging comma.
  Also, the format of the error message has been changed so that now
  the error message also contains the value of the key which is duplicated.
  Instead of `Duplicate key found in Dictionary literal`, it now prints
  `Duplicate key "<value>" found in Dictionary literal`
- Tighter shadow culling - fix light colinear to frustum edge
  In rare situations if a light is placed near colinear to a frustum edge, the extra culling plane derived can have an inaccurate normal due to floating point error.
  This PR detects colinear triangles, and prevents adding a culling plane in this situation.
- Add Node.is_node_ready
- nanosvg: Sync with upstream 93ce879
  https://github.com/memononen/nanosvg/commit/93ce879dc4c04a3ef1758428ec80083c38610b1f
- Backported ORMSpatialMaterial from Godot 3.x without any breaking changes.
- FIXED: Trying to connect inexistent signal text_submitted.
- Backport locale selection improvements.
- Fix building with `disable_3d`
- Fix SceneTree dock filter crash. The filter was crashing for two reasons: 1) Deleting a child invalidated the iteration of children 2) Child was accessed after deletion
- Rotary input for 3.x
- Fix GodotEditText white box showing during game load
- Discrete Level of Detail
  Add scene side discrete level of detail.
  New node `LOD` for UI, and `LODManager` within `World` for automatically updating child visibilities based on distance from cameras.
- Remove deprecated LaunchImages support and switch to Storyboard by default.
- Fix finding AnimationPlayer in scene import
  The scene importer always assumed that the AnimationPlayer is called
  "AnimationPlayer".
  This is not always true: for example the GLTF importer just creates an
  AnimationPlayer with the default name, which may be "animation_player",
  depending on the project settings.
  This fix instead chooses the first node that is an AnimationPlayer, and
  warns if there is more than one.
- Physics Interpolation 2D - fix light and light occluder resetting
  It turns out `NOTIFICATION_TRANSFORM_CHANGED` is deferred for these nodes, which can mean the transform is not set in the `VisualServer` until after the reset has been sent, even if the transform is set before the reset in script. This prevented the reset from acting correctly.
  Here we explicitly set the transform prior to each reset, to ensure the `VisualServer` is up to date.
- Optimize `AnimationTree::_process_graph()` Removes redundant lookups on HashMap.
- Allow automatic provisioning in iOS when using development signature. Implements https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/86748/files in 3.x.
- Physics Interpolation 2D - change transform API to use const ref
- GDNative: Fix Linux arm32 warning about ignored sysv_abi attribute
- Add a `get_or_add` method to Dictionary
- Fix `Mesh::get_face_count()`
  This fixes a minor bug whereby facecount was actually returning the facecount * 3.
  There were no major problems from this, but it did mean the optional threshold poly count used when merging was out by a factor of 3.

- Backported everything up to and including https://github.com/godotengine/godot/commit/b859a1898d82ff5d0c568d45b45eabc054d981cf Merge commit: https://github.com/godotengine/godot/commit/cc4492f9b9ccb8d93c132d97ca3439b8ba925b08

- Ported:  Update the logic used to start / stop the GL thread Currently the GL thread is started / stopped when the activity is respectively resumed / paused. However, according to the `GLSurfaceView` documentation, this should be done instead when the activity is started / stopped, so this change updates the start / stop logic for the GL thread to match the documentation. - m4gr3d https://github.com/godotengine/godot/commit/194452bf38e5a0de0f1c8e0698244a6f47b88a08

The rendering formula in the shader was adjusted to further improve the sharpness/antialiasing quality balance. - lawnjelly and Calinou https://github.com/godotengine/godot/commit/bc607fb6075cebf78d8e562d7b7423b2650906ac
- Ported:  Shadow volume culling and tighter shadow caster culling Existing shadow caster culling using the BVH takes no account of the camera. This PR adds the highly encapsulated class VisualServerLightCuller which can cut down the casters in the shadow volume to only those which can cast shadows on the camera frustum. This is used to: * More accurately defer dirty updates to shadows when the shadow volume does not intersect the camera frustum. * Tighter cull shadow casters to the view frustum. Lights dirty state is now automatically managed: * Continuous (tighter caster culling) * Static (all casters are rendered) - lawnjelly https://github.com/godotengine/godot/commit/8ca631a466e3dfe0d6e0bce54c6a78c652fca81c

In VisualServer they should therefore ignore local transform. 2) Additionally, the expected final_transform should be passed on to children, rather than the identity transform used on the local item. 3) Local bounds in hierarchical culling are fixed for items using identity transform, by calculating their local bound in local space from the global space particles. - lawnjelly https://github.com/godotengine/godot/commit/723632a76a6d88c2f95ef728bbf2f7182cab05a0
- Ported from godot:  Fix Android input routing logic when using a hardware keyboard When a hardware keyboard is connected, all key events come through so we can route them directly to the engine. This is not the case for soft keyboards, for which the current logic was designed as it requires extra processing. - m4gr3d https://github.com/godotengine/godot/commit/620fdd1f078908e665a0eb2dd71306016c785abd

#### Other

- Ported godot pr: [3.x] Allow exporting custom resources from/to any scripting language (GDScript, VisualScript, C#, NativeScript, PluginScript) - willnationsdev https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/44879 Using the rebased version from https://github.com/Atlinx/godot/commit/02d1f70ee5ec1b7bb08bc6dddac7fe39b4727e1e by Atlinx

## [4.0.0]

### Added

#### Core

- Bind RWLock, so it's accessible to scripts.
- Implemented a new ProcessGroup Node. It can be used to multithread scenes updates.
It was insipred by godot 4's ProcessGroup system, however while Godot 4's implementation tries to hide threaded processing as much as possible, this implementation focuses on making it explicitly known and obvious to the user, in a (hopefully) almost bolierplate free way. Also with the available options this node can be used for other purposes, like multi threaded cron job like method calls when paired with a Timer in manual mode.
- Ported parts of: Refactor Node Processing * Node processing works on the concept of process groups. * A node group can be inherited, run on main thread, or a sub-thread. * Groups can be ordered. * Process priority is now present for physics. This is the first steps towards implementing godotengine/godot-proposals#6424. No threading or thread guards exist yet in most of the scene code other than Node. That will have to be added later. - reduz https://github.com/godotengine/godot/commit/98c655ec8db17e50afa58284b1dcad754034db4b - Only got the smaller improvements, and the thread safety for Node and SceneTree. I'm planning to implement a similar system, but I have a different way of doing it in mind.

#### Modules

##### CSG

- Added back the csg module from godot.
- Ported the navigation geometry parsers for the csg module.
- Only build CSGGizmos when building the editor.
- Added back CSG support code I removed.

##### Web

- Implemented custom response headers for WebServerRequest.

##### GDNative

- Added back gdnative as a built in module. It was worked on in this repository: https://github.com/Relintai/gdnative .

### Fixed

- Fix binding inconsistencies.
- Fix property bind inconsistency.
- Fix property binding hints.
- Fix property types. Auras have been merged into Spells a while ago.
- Fix some property names being the same as getters / setters.
- Fixed disrepancies between a few getter and setters.
- Bind missing enum values.
- Fix duplicate parameter names in binding.
- Fix the order of some default arguments in bindings.

#### Core

- Fix building with ptrcall on.
- Fix the return type of PoolVector::count().
- Added grow_by and to_rect2 helper method to Rect2i.
- Now Basis::get_uniform_scale() returns a real_t instead of a float.
- Mark the parameters of Basis::rotate_to_align as const ref.
- Apparently Basis::rotate_to_align had a bug. Ported the fix by lyuma from: https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/77469/commits/6dfa6fc50e957dcffd6b2c33cc5a88448918d8a5
- Fix error, also add linear_interpolate call for Vector4i to variant op.
- Fix small inconsistencies in Vector3/3i/4/4i apis.
- Also bind Vector3i set_all().
- Added set_all() to Vector3i.
- Made the parameter of snap and snapped in Vector3 const reference.
- Make the parameters of String's and PoolVector's join() const ref.
- Fix handling dots in String::is_numeric().

#### Platforms

##### Android Editor

- Implemented switching between the running game and the editor in the android editor.
- Fix debugging on the android editor.
- Added warning for the android editor that android will kill the game after a few seconds if it's opened in the same window as the editor and then it goes to the backgond. Should be still enough to see what's the issue of you don't intentionally debug break though.

##### Windows

- Update the variant types in the windows natvis file.

#### Modules

##### Skeleton3D

- Fixed SkeletonModification3DFABRIK.

##### FastNoise

- Fix the type of FastnoiseNoiseParams::get_fractal_octaves().

##### Entity Spell System

- Fix virtual method names in Entity.

##### GLTF

- Fix registering types in the gltf module.

#### Docs

- Re-extracted class docs.
- Fix godot4 syntax in docs.
- Add missing classes to the editor_code_editor module's class list.
- Fix lots of small issues with the docs.

### Changed

#### Core

- Merged the functionality of BSInputEventKey to InputEventKey. This new setting can make input event keys act as if they are shortcut matched.

##### ThreadPool

- Removed _execute method bind from the NavigationMeshGenerator jobs.
- Don't print an error in ThreadPoolJob's _execute, as it's probably more intuitive this way.
- Don't bind _execute() method in ThreadPoolJob derived classes, as it's not needed anymore.
- Emit the completed signal automatically in ThreadPoolJob.
- Added virtual _execute to threadPoolJob.

#### Modules

##### Navigation

- Backported lots of improvements to the Navigation Servers from Godot 4. See the list in the Backports section.
- Renamed neighbor_dist properties / getters / setters for the navigation server.

##### MeshDataResource

- Use the new scaled grab radius in MDIGizmo.

##### Entity Spell System

- Move the enums from the top of spell.h into the Spell class.
- Added code to load old resource properties where applicable, to help converting resources to the new fixed apis. These will be removed after the next release.
- Renamed get_stat, and set_stat in Entity. It's just a smell c++ side helper method, they aren't bound. Should not require any changes like the rest.
- Fix Entity's api's inconsistencies.

In projects mass replacing the following words will update everything:

This commit introduced the `CANCELED` state, which signals that an ongoing input event has been canceled. To represent all the states, the `InputEventState` enum is added and the `InputEvent` logic is refactored accordingly. - m4gr3d https://github.com/godotengine/godot/commit/94d6c3dcc68f9de4b7c004e3a18513edb1d5dda2

#### Godot4

- Support threads in the script debugger * This implementation adds threads on the side of the client (script debugger). * Some functions of the debugger are optimized. * The profile is also now thread safe using atomics. * The editor can switch between multiple threads when debugging. This PR adds threaded support for the script language debugger. Every thread has its own thread local data and it will connect to the debugger using multiple thread IDs. This means that, now, the editor can receive multiple threads entering debug mode at the same time. - reduz PR 76582 Will be available here after it's merged: https://github.com/godotengine/godot/commit/6b176671c4289e9096ea94583fae35f2c4686b7c

#### Core

- Now the Engine has methods to store globals (custom singletons). They are mostly meant for classes like EditorInterface, SpatialEditor, and plugin scripts that need a singleton for in-editor use. In essence it provides easy and side effect less access for classes that might not be present on every run. (For example gdscript recognizes normal singletons as keywords, but not these.) Also registered EditorInterface, SpatialEditor, CanvasItemEditor, and WebNodeEditor as globals.
- Added msvc versions of the no-rtti and no-exceptions options. (They are disabled temporarily)
- Use FALLTHROUGH macro instead on [[fallthrough]]; 

#### Engine

#### Platforms

- Updated frt2 to the latest.

#### Modules

- Cleaned up old _PRESENT defines, now everything uses module configs.

##### TileSet

- Renamed RTileMap ro TileMap and RTileSet to TileSet, as it does not need to be able to live alongside Godot's TileMap anymore. Also added compatibility classes.

##### Editor

- Now full screen editor plugins have the ability to hide their tab button in the top bar.
- Now the editor won't treat a hidden main button as an indicator that their editor plugin is disabled. This behavior was used to be a part of editor feature profiles, which I removed a long time ago.

##### Nodes

- Backported ImporterMesh and ImporterMeshInstance3D from Godot4. 
- Backported ImmediateMesh from Godot4.

##### Skeletons

Improves 3D model compatibility (non uniform transforms will properly work, as well as all animations coming from Autodesk products).)

##### Networking

- Removed rsets.
- Moved visibility rpcs (vrpc) from Entity to Node. Also added an unreliable variant.
- Added a few small networking related helper methods to Node. Made the rpc macros in Entity use them.
- Removed deprecated enum values from multiplayerPeer.
- Removed additional direct script rpc mode query when sending rpcs, in order to simplify that codepath as much as possible. Also removed the remote, remotesync etc. keywords from gdscript, as now they won't work anymore. Node's rpc_config() method should be used instead of marking methods with keywords in scripts.

#### Modules

### Fixed

- Actually check whether modules are enabled, not just for their existence in mesh_data_resource's SCsub.
- Check whether the gltf module is enabled or not before trying to use it.
- Main build script: Properly set module_ name _enabled in environment to false for modules that get disabled using can_build().
